# Redsons Band Website

This repository contains the source code of a website I helped build during high school for the band **Redsons**, formed by one of our teachers.  

The project was a collaborative and creative effort, combining what we had learned about HTML, CSS, and basic web design to create a custom website that showcased the band’s identity, music, and style.

Although simple, this project was an important early step in applying programming and design skills to a real-world context — and a fun memory of that time.

> Project developed in high school as part of a class initiative.
